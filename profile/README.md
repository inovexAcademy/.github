### Our Approach to Training

From needs assessment to certification, we offer tailored training programs designed flexibly and delivered according to your specific requirements.

- **_Needs Assessment_**  
If you are interested in in-house training, we start by assessing your needs and discussing your goals in an initial conversation. This serves as the foundation for a preliminary proposal.
- **_Training Design_**  
Once the framework is established, our trainers begin tailoring the training content. Many of our courses are modular, allowing for a flexible agenda. Courses that prepare for certifications, however, are less flexible, although you can still set the focus areas according to your preferences.
- **_Execution_**  
Prior to the training, you will receive all relevant information. The training then takes place at your chosen location and at the agreed-upon time. Our trainers align closely with your specific requirements.
- **_Evaluation_**  
Upon completion of the training, all participants receive a certificate of attendance. You will also have the opportunity to provide feedback on the content and structure. We always welcome praise and suggestions for improvement.

### Our Trainers

Our trainers are seasoned experts in their fields. Through their work in projects, they continually expand their knowledge and share this expertise in their training sessions â€” focused on real-world application and practical relevance.
